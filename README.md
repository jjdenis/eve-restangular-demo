# eve-restangular-demo
A minimal demo of eve and restangular

I went through all the steps to quick start eve:

http://python-eve.org/quickstart.html

So what now?

Now I want to develop an basic CRUD app, using restangular.

But I am not too skilled with web servers, wgi, etc so...

The html, css, and js will be served by eve itself.

This is a work in progress, so far I have managed to list all people and add new people, I am still figuring out how to delete and edit.
